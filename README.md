# I-Feel-Your-Pain-The-Right-Superior-Temporal-Sulcus-Reflexively-Decodes-the-Pain-of-Others

Empathy broadly refers to one´s ability to feel or understand the experience of others. Elucidating the neural basis of empathy with functional MRI (fMRI) is challenging. Firstly, in experimental settings, the construct of empathy is commonly confounded by the computations underlying its reportability. Secondly, there is currently no available metric for quantifying empathic performance against any ground truth. Here we circumvent these issues by introducing a blinded and incidental psychophysical task in which observers quantitatively decode the pain experience of others. By exploiting the power-law between cutaneous electrical current and subjective pain, we stochastically induced variable magnitude of pain in target subjects whilst acquiring head-centric video recordings. 50 naïve female observers underwent fMRI while performing an attentionally demanding luminance estimation task. The videos of a target subject were implicitly presented parafoveally at the time of luminance change. In a subsequent session, the same observers were shown the same stimuli and instead instructed to explicitly attend to, and estimate the magnitude of, the subjective pain of the target person. We found that the psycho-psychophysical (PPP) functions which map from the target’s pain to the observer's decoded pain were predictive of the neurometric responses in the right superior temporal sulcus (rSTS). Follow-up analyses revealed that activation levels in this region reflected the target’s pain in both the implicit and the explicit conditions. Variation in these rSTS responses was predictive of differences in the empathic sensitivity of the observers. Our results implicate the rSTS in the empathic encoding of pain. Specifically, the rSTS encodes the subjective pain of others and does so reflexively even in the context of substantial and irrelevant cognitive loads.
