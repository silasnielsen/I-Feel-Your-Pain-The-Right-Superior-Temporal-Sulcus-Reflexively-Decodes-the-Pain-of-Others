50 female participants (mean age (SD) = 24.9 (4.9)) were scanned between day 5 and 12 of the menstrual cycle, with the exception of four subjects who reported irregular periods. This was to avoid potential noise introduced by differences in emotional processing across the menstrual cycle. Exclusion criteria included a history of antipsychotic or antidepressant treatment, and any diagnosis of affective disorder.
